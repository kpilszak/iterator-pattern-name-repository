## General info
This project shows usage of iterator pattern.  
The main principle is to provide access to the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its representation.  
In iterator pattern we create an Iterator interface which narrates navigation method and a Container interface which retruns the iterator. Concrete classes implementing the Container interface will be responsible for implementing Iterator interface and using it.
